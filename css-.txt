css:-

create a folder n open it with vs code
create a file in css with the name .html


apply styling:-
----------------
3 types:- internal,external,inline

1.inline
-----------

we can apply styles in html where we require near the tags.
by applying style attribute
code style = "color : red ;font-size:30";>

ex:-
-----

<h1 style=" color: blue; font-size: 30; ">this is the first prgm in css</h1>
    <h1 style=" color: rgb(255, 0, 111); font-size: 30; ">welcome</h1>

* this method will makes long code n clumsyness.
.
internal:-
----------
to reduce the length of the code we use this method.
we add the style tag in head.

ex:-
<head>
<style>
h1{
color:blue
fpnt-size:30px;
}</style>
</head>

the drawback in it is if add the style to one tag then every data with the same tag will have same style.
we can add style to any tag in the head.

ex:- we can add h1 tag p tag at the same time

external:
---------

to reduce the length n clumsiness we use this method.
mostly this external link will be used in the program as it is easy to understand easy to write & easy to retify error if any as the styling is in diff page & code is in diff page. 
we wont write the style in same page which has code we will write it in another file.
creation of new file:-
go to explorer create a new file wibt with.css extension
 
writh the style sheet code for the required tags.

ex:-
----
h1{
    color: blue;
    font-size: 30px;
}
p{
    color: red;
    font-size: 20px;
}

create a link between css n html file.

ex:-
-----

<link rel="stylesheet" href="firsr_css.css"/> in html file

priority method :-
-------------------
the priority will be in this way in html for styling:-
inline>internal>external

when we apply the 3 types method in the code at a time  then the priority of inline will be more when compared to other two.

when we apply the 2 types methods(internal & external ) in the code at a time  then the priority of internal will be more when compared to other two.

selector:-
-----------

a selector 

we can apply css style for a single or group of elements at atimeas per requirment.
there are 4 typees:-
group selector
element
id
class

1.group selector:-
---------------------
instead of  applying style to single elements we can apply them by group

ex:-
 body{

color: blue
bgcolor: pink;
}

when we apply this then whole data inside tht group will get same style.

2.element selector:-
---------------------
we can apply styling for diff elements at a time,which makes that particular data & the data with the same element name  will have same style as the element name is same.

ex:-
-----
h1{
    color: aqua;
    background-color: pink;
}

h2{

    color : orange;
    background: rosybrown;

}
p{
    color: blueviolet;
    background-color: aqua;
}
p1{

    color: chartreuse;
    background-color: dimgray ;
}


3.id selector:-
----------------
we can keep diff styles for data if the element is same also.

in html class every element has to have an id.

ex:-
---
<h1 id="mainhead">cheran</h1>
<h1 id="sechead">cheran</h1>
<h2 id="thirdhead">cheran</h2>
<p id="firstpara">cheran</p>
<p id="secpara">cheran</p>

then in css class we  ned to mention the id name as # with id name.

ex:-
----
#firsthead{
    color: aqua;
    background-color: pink;
}

#sechead{

    color : orange;
    background: rosybrown;

}

class selector:-
-----------------
it is same as id selector instead of writing id in html we write class and in css class we mention it as .(dot) & cls name.

ex:-
------
in html cls:-
---------------
 <h1 class="first">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</h1>
    <h2 class="third four">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Tempora iure quis dicta.</h2>
    
    <div class="first four">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Vitae suscipit et earum tempore omnis obcaecati quaerat, necessitatibus aut labore blanditiis quidem eum officiis molestias eveniet magnam error neque accusantium! Quae.</div>
    <div class="second">
        <p>Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Reprehenderit sed nihil, laudantium totam neque natus blanditiis ea odit! Nisi maxime provident accusamus cumque beatae magnam.</p>
    </div>

in css class;-
---------------
.first{
    color:antiquewhite;
    background-color: blue;
}

.second{
    color:azure;
    background-color: coral;

}

we can keep more one class for a particular element at a time by keeping space between space between cls names.


selector preference ;-
-----------------------

id>class>element>group


id will get the first priority then class then element then group.

*if same element has been styled twice then the new one will get the priority.
as the code runs as top to bottom then the the first one will be override the sec one.
*if same id has been styled twice then the new one will get the priority.
as the code runs as top to bottom then the the first one will be override the sec one.

* if we keep *{
color=blue;
}
then the whole website will be in blue as * is known as universal selector.





giving style to set of data in a paragraph:-
--------------------------------------------

we need to select the data which need to styled by by span n need to give a class name for it.
then in css we need to call the .class name n write the code.

ex:-
----
in html class;-
----------------
<p> my name is<span class="special"> cheran</span></p>
<span class="special"> show in upper case</span>

in css classs;-
---------------

.special{

    color: blueviolet;
    background-color: black;
}


values:-
----------
there are 5 types in values
absolute
relative
pixels
em
rem
vw:-
vh:-

absolute value:-
------------------
which will nt change

relative:-
it will depend onn absolute / pRENT VALUES.'
